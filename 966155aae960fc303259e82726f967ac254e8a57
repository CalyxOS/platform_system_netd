If so wouldn\u0027t this cause conflicts with such additions later (in which case we\u0027d have to resolve the conflict at that time)? And if the entire reserved space is used then there\u0027d be no good solution since the entire fwmark would be used by one thing or another (in which case we\u0027d need our own separate solution)?",
