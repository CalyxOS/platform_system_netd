      "message": "Forgot to post this comment, but it is now resolved.\n\nIn PS2 and below, the new remove method overload for UidRangeParcel removed *every* instance of the range, in the event there were multiple. `UidRanges::remove(const UidRanges\u0026 other)` does not remove *every* instance of the supplied ranges. This is basically a convenience method, preventing the need to construct a new UidRanges. It should function the same, though. Now, it does.\n\nAlso, because I\u0027m not incredibly familiar with C++ compared to Java, I researched and then tested the vector manipulation behavior with some messy test code executed on my PC - not included here, but can share if wanted.",
